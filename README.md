# Text Classification and Generation using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks

## Overview
This project implements text classification and text generation using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Recurrent Neural Networks. The two models are trained on the AG News dataset, which contains news articles labeled by category. The project leverages TorchText for text processing and PyTorch as the core deep learning library.
